## Challenges and Solutions

One of the major challenges was optimizing the dashboard to handle large datasets without performance degradation. This was resolved by implementing:

1. Virtualized lists for rendering large data tables
2. Pagination for API requests to limit data transfer
3. Memoization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. Service worker for caching frequently accessed data
