# Project Guideline

## Mobile First

The project must be designed and optimized for mobile devices first. It should be lightweight and load quickly. Every element should be adapted for mobile screens.

### Best Practices
- **Responsive Design**: Use media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize the use of heavy assets and scripts to ensure fast loading times.
- **Touch-Friendly UI**: Ensure that all interactive elements are easily tappable and usable on touch devices.
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Include the viewport meta tag in the HTML to control the layout on mobile browsers.

## Keep It Simple

The project should be simple, both in terms of functionality and structure. No unnecessary complexity, no over-engineering.

### Best Practices
- **Minimalistic Design**: Focus on essential features and avoid adding unnecessary elements.
- **Clear Navigation**: Ensure that the navigation is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Consistent UI**: Maintain a consistent design language throughout the project.
- **Code Simplicity**: Write clean and maintainable code, avoiding over-engineering.

## Project Structure

The main section is the Landing page. The structure consists of content blocks stacked one after another. A 3D scene should be in the background. No 2D animationsâ€”if animations are needed, they must be 3D only.

### Best Practices
- **Modular Design**: Break down the project into reusable components.
- **Content Hierarchy**: Organize content in a logical and hierarchical manner.
- **3D Animations**: Use Three.js for creating 3D animations and avoid using 2D animations.
- **Background Optimization**: Ensure that the 3D scene in the background does not affect the performance of the main content.

## Development Rules

After every change, edits must be checked. Every major feature must be finalized and committed properly.

### Best Practices
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and perform thorough testing after every change.
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes.
- **Documentation**: Maintain proper documentation for the codebase and any major changes.
