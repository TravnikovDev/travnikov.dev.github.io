# Implementation Summary

## Project Structure Overview

This project implements the requirements specified in TASK.MD. Below is a concise summary of the components and features implemented and recent refactors.

### 1. Technology Stack

- **Gatsby**: static site generator
- **Mantine UI**: UI framework used for components (Card, Modal, AspectRatio, etc.)
- **Three.js (via React Three Fiber)**: for decorative 3D animations on the homepage
- **Strapi CMS**: configured for content management (where applicable)
- **GitHub Pages & Actions**: CI/CD and deployment

### 2. Website Sections & Key Components

#### 2.1 Main Page (Landing Page)
- `HeroSection` — main landing area with 3D/intro
- `LandingSection` — a small, reusable wrapper component that accepts a title, optional description and children. (This replaces the previous tightly-coupled Timeline-only component for general landing subsections.)
- Multiple landing subsections are now implemented as `LandingSection` blocks (examples: My projects, My apps, My libraries, My extensions, My Commercial Working History, YouTube widget, My skills, What I can help you with).

#### 2.2 ShowcaseGrid (Projects / Items)
- `ShowcaseGrid` — a reusable grid component used inside `LandingSection` to display projects, packages, extensions, skills and work items.
	- Items support: `image` (thumbnail/logo), `icon` (react-icon element), `url` (external link), `title`, `description`, and `alt`.
	- Fallback priority: image → icon → default placeholder icon.
	- Items with a `url` are rendered as plain anchor (`<a href="...">`) wrappers for SEO/crawlability (opens in new tab). Items without `url` open a modal showing details.

#### 2.3 Career / Timeline
- A dedicated `LandingSection` now hosts the "My Commercial Working History" showcase which lists employment records. Each record is a `ShowcaseGrid` item that opens a modal with employment dates and short responsibilities/achievements.

#### 2.4 Projects & Marketplace
- Project links (for libraries, extensions, and marketplaces) use plain `<a>` links to external pages (npm, Chrome Web Store, Etsy) so search engines can discover them. Example: the Etsy project is linked to `https://neurofashion.etsy.com/` and uses the `BiLogoEtsy` icon.

### 3. Styling & CSS Modules
- `ShowcaseGrid` styles live in a CSS module: `src/components/landing/ShowcaseGrid.module.css`.
- CSS Modules typings are declared in `src/types/css-modules.d.ts` so TypeScript accepts `*.module.css` imports.
- Icon sizing/normalization: Icons passed as react-icon elements are cloned and given inline styles (width/height 100%) so they visually match across sections; additional SVG rules live in the CSS module to ensure consistent rendering.

### 4. Behavior & Accessibility
- Modal: items without `url` open a Mantine `Modal` with a larger media area and a description. The modal is centered and keyboard-focusable (Mantine handles focus trapping by default).
- External links: items with `url` are anchor elements with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

### 5. Performance & SEO
- Anchor links for external resources improve crawlability.
- Structured data and meta tags remain in place via `SEO` utilities.

### 6. Developer Workflow
- TypeScript checks are used during CI and locally via `npm run typecheck`.

## Next Steps / Suggestions

1. Replace placeholder icons with company logos (`image`) where available for stronger branding.
2. Provide a central data source (JSON or GraphQL/Strapi) for `ShowcaseGrid` items to avoid in-file lists.
3. Add keyboard navigation to `ShowcaseGrid` tiles (arrow navigation) if desired.
4. Improve responsive breakpoints for the grid (more granular column counts by viewport).

If you want, I can extract the Commercial Working History into a standalone component and/or migrate the item data into a JSON file or CMS model.
